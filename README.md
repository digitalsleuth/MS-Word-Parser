# ********** Description **********
#
# Script will open a windows dialog to allow you to select a DOCx file.
# The script does not attempt to validate the file.
# A docx file is nothing more than a ZIP file, hence why this script uses the zipfile library.
#
# It will extract the results to a file called docx-artifacts.xlsx as defined by the variable excel_file_path at the
# start of the main part of the script.
# If the file does not exist, it creates it. If the file does exist, it appends to it.
# The file will be located in the folder where the script is executed from.
# If executing from the GUI by double-clicking on the .py file, it should be stored in that same folder.
# If executing it from the command line, it will create it in whichever folder you are in when executing it.
#
# This allows you to run this repeatedly against many DOCx file for an investigation and compare them.
# You can then copy/move/rename the default file, docx-artifacts.xlsx to another file name for your case.
#
# Processes that this script will do:
#
# 1 - It will extract a list of all the files within the zip file and save it to a worksheet called XML_files.
#     In this worksheet, it will save the following information to a row:
#     "File Name", "XML", "Size (bytes)", "MD5Hash"
#
# 2 - It will extract all the unique RSIDs from the file word/settings.xml and write it to a worksheet
#     called doc_summary.
#     In this worksheet, it will save the following information to a row:
#     "File Name", "Unique RSIDs", "RSID Root", "<w:p> tags", "<w:r> tags", "<w:t> tags"
#     Where "Unique RSID" is a numerical count of the # of RSIDs in the file.
#
#     What is an RSID (Revision Save ID)?
#     See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.rsid?view=openxml-2.8.1
#
# 3 - It will extract all the unique RSIDs from the file word/settings.xml and write it to a worksheet called rsids.
#     In this worksheet, it will save the following information to rows (one for each unique RSID):
#     "File Name", "RSID"
#
# 3 - It will extract all known relevant metadata from the files docProps/app.xml and docProps/core.xml
#     and write it to a worksheet called metadata.
#     In this worksheet, it will save the following information to a row:
#     "File Name", "Author", "Created Date","Last Modified By","Modified Date","Last Printed Date","Manager","Company",
#     "Revision","Total Editing Time","Pages","Paragraphs","Lines","Words","Characters","Characters With Spaces",
#     "Title","Subject","Keywords","Description","Application","App Version","Template","Doc Security","Category",
#     "contentStatus"
#
#
# ********** Dependencies **********
#
# If running the script on a Linux system, you may need to install python-tk. You can do this with the following
# command on a Debian (e.g. Ubuntu) system from the terminal window:
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#
# Whether running on Linux, Mac, or Windows, you may need to install some of the libraries if they are not included in
# your installation of Python 3.
# In particular, you may need to install openpyxl and hashlib. You can do so as follows from a terminal window:
#
# pip3 install openpyxl
# pip3 install hashlib
#
# If any other libraries are missing when trying to execute the script, install those in the same manner.
